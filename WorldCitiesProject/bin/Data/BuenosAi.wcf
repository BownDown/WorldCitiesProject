Buenos Aires is the capital and largest city of Argentina. 
The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of 
the Río de la Plata, on the South American continent's 
southeastern coast. "Buenos Aires" can be translated as 
"fair winds" or "good airs", but the former was the 
meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century, by 
the use of the original name "Real de Nuestra Señora 
Santa María del Buen Ayre". The Greater Buenos Aires 
conurbation, which also includes several Buenos Aires 
Province districts, constitutes the fourth-most populous 
metropolitan area in the Americas, with a population of 
around 14 million.[3] The city of Buenos Aires is 
neither part of Buenos Aires Province nor the Province's 
capital; rather, it is an autonomous district. In 1880, 
after decades of political infighting, Buenos Aires was 
federalized and removed from Buenos Aires Province.[7] 
The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of 
Belgrano and Flores; both are now neighborhoods of the 
city. The 1994 constitutional amendment granted the city 
autonomy, hence its formal name: Autonomous City of 
Buenos Aires (Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires; "CABA"). 
Its citizens first elected a chief of government 
(i.e. mayor) in 1996; previously, the mayor was directly 
appointed by the President of the Republic.Buenos Aires 
is considered an 'alpha city' by the study GaWC5.[8] 
Buenos Aires' quality of life was ranked 91st in the world, 
being one of the best in Latin America in 2018.[9][10] It 
is the most visited city in South America, and the 
second-most visited city of Latin America.
Buenos Aires is a top tourist destination,[12] and is known 
for its preserved Eclectic European architecture[13] 
and rich cultural life.[14] Buenos Aires held the 1st Pan 
American Games in 1951 as well as hosting two venues in the 
1978 FIFA World Cup. Buenos Aires hosted the 2018 Summer 
Youth Olympics[15] and the 2018 G20 summit.[16]
Buenos Aires is a multicultural city, being home to 
multiple ethnic and religious groups. Several languages are
spoken in the city in addition to Spanish, contributing to 
its culture and the dialect spoken in the city and in some 
other parts of the country. This is because in the last 150 
years the city, and the country in general, has been a 
major recipient of millions of immigrants from all over 
the world, making it a melting pot where several ethnic 
groups live together and being considered as one of the 
most diverse cities of the Americas.[17]
